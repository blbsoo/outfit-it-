# outFIT it

Welcome to the **outFIT it** app! This project aims to revolutionize how we approach fashion and outfit selection using technology.


## Introduction

Society has developed fast, and innovations have been created. We have now reached a stage where most daily tasks revolve around and work in unison with technology - fashion proving not to be an anomaly. With the emergence and evolution of communication mediums such as the internet, fashion and the way people dress themselves and choose their outfits have taken a whole new direction.

Many of us have experienced having a wardrobe full of clothes yet finding nothing to wear. Not everyone is fashion-savvy nor can everyone afford personal stylists to plan their looks. This is the fundamental problem that the **outFIT it** app seeks to provide a solution to.

**outFIT it** is more than an online wardrobe; it is a clothing app that helps users get fresh, original outfit inspiration from their pre-existing clothing selection. It also provides a medium for users to approach fashion experts for tips to improve their looks, and more.

## Project Aims

Given the lack of knowledge in some technological areas such as AI and Swift programming language, this project will aim to:

- Build a minimalist, simple system with fewer choices to make the experience as simple and enjoyable as possible for users.
- Utilize the camera on the device to take photos, upload them, and save them in an online closet.
- Build a real-time chat feature where users can send photos and videos.
- Implement a push notification feature for receiving messages.

## Features

- Create an account, log in, log out, and reset the password.
- Upload and categorize clothing items into an online wardrobe.
- Request outfit suggestions from other users.
- Chat with other users and fashion experts.
- Receive personalized fashion advice.
- Future enhancement: Scan the entire body via the device camera to create a 3D model for virtual try-ons.

## Target Demographics

This project targets two particular demographics:

1. Individuals who enjoy dealing with clothes and assembling outfits for others, such as fashion students or people with an interest in clothing.
2. Users who seek help to get outfit ideas for particular events.

## Future Enhancements

- 3D body scanning using the device camera to create a model with real-life measurements.
- Virtual try-ons with the ability to change the background to different event environments.
